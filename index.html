			<p>Hi! As you might have found out fromt he title of this page my Name is Colin and im a senior in computer science at Langara College. <br> Im also Customer Service Agent at YVR airport in Vancouver and a cook at Minato Sushi restaurant.  </p>

			<p>During highschool I was enrolled into an early engineers program funded by SAP where I developed my love for science and mechanics. On days when im not working or attending classes I enjoy working on my Q50RS by adding mods and doing regular maintanence, im currently self taught when it comes to basic car maintanence and car detailing so im by no means near a professional.
                I also enjoy playing games and eating out when time permits.</p>

			<p> These projects include a fully autonomous hydroponics greenhouse thats programed to add nutrients and turn on blue lights when light is absent and also borax crystal growing incubation chambers that keep tempurature at a constant so that
                crystals would grow in the perfect environment. </p>
